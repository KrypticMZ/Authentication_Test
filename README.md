# Authentication_Test
Wanted to see if I could make some sort of encrypted authentication system and this is what I came up with. Might add a GUI in the future if I can be bothered. Also accounts are stored in your C drive under "Authentication Test"

I made this on and for Windows 10 might not work on other operating systems.
