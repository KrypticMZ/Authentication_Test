# Authentication_Test
Wanted to see if I could make some sort of encrypted authentication system and this is what I came up with. Might add a GUI in the future if I can be bothered. Also accounts are stored in your C drive under "Authentication Test"

I made this on and for Windows 10 might not work on other operating systems.
Also before running you will need to download bcrypt so go to command prompt and type "py -m pip install bcrypt" (You will also need python duh).
